    I joined the us-east-1 channel at 2:00 pm on Tuesday(02/02/2021) and discussed about the above topics. 

* [ ] Complete "On your own": Ubuntu up script (10)

    The code for the Ubuntu up script is checked into the respository. Below are the screen shots of App running on localhost and after port forward.

* [ ] Complete the [CLI notebook](https://docable.cloud/chrisparnin/notebooks/nodejs/CLI/cli.md) 

    Find the sucess output of the code snippets in the notebook below. The code for cli.js can be found checked into the repository.

* [ ] Complete "Docker workshop" 

    * Creating the directory structure for the rootfs, downloading the busybox distribution, installing symlinks inside the rootfs, test running of container.

    * Starting an interactive shell in the container.

    * Creating a container.sh file, to create a new snapshot of the filesystem everytime is it launched in order to run the container.

    ![docker3](resources_imgs/docker3.png) 

    * Installing docer in VM, verifying can run docker

    ![docker4](resources_imgs/docker4.png)  

    * Checking size of the images

    ![docker5](resources_imgs/docker5.png)   

    * Creating a simple container.

    ![docker6](resources_imgs/docker6.png)   

    *  Building the docker image, and name it "java11"

    ![docker7](resources_imgs/docker7.png)   

    * Looking at all the containers 

    ![docker8](resources_imgs/docker8.png)   

    * Running in daemon mode and commiting to image

### Answer the following conceptual questions 

* Why can code be difficult to run on another machine? 



* Explain the concepts of a computing environment and headless infrastructure.
* Compare full emulation virtualization vs. binary translation
* What are some use cases associated with microvms and unikernels?


* In VM workshop, why can't the eth0 ip address be pinged from the host?
* How can bakerx access the virtual machine through ssh?
* What are the limitations of using chroot for os-virtualization?
* Why is the builder pattern useful for building images?

# Virtual Machine provisioning with CLI program 

The script for both up.js and ssh.js are available in command folder of the repository. 

#### VM setup

The code for the customization of the VM is available in up.js file from line 101 to 103.

#### Post-Configuration 

The code for the customization of the VM is available in up.js file in the line 110.

#### SSH and App
The code for the customization of the VM is available in ssh.js file.

## Screencast

* Below is the link demonstrating running of code to provision the VM (`v up`), running my customization and post-configuration steps, and ssh (`v ssh`) and a starting your App. It also demonstrates my app running on the browser.
